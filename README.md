##1. About the library
This tiny library is intended to be used with DC motor driver boards based on TI's DRV8833 chip. One chip supports two motors, each can be driven in both directions with different speeds. Each motor can be stopped in two different modes, braking (slow current decay) or coasting (fast current decay). This library implements all mentioned above.
##2. How to use
Download ZIP, install through Arduino IDE: Sketch -> Include library -> Add .ZIP library. See "Examples" for additional information.
